# Introduction

Kobalte is a UI toolkit for building accessible web apps and design systems with SolidJS. It provides a set of low-level UI components and primitives which can be the foundation for your design system implementation.

## Key features

### Accessible

Components follow the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) whenever possible. Kobalte handle accessibility implementation details like ARIA attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation.

### Composable

Kobalte provides granular access to each component parts, so you can wrap them and add your own event listeners, props, etc.

### Unstyled

Components are shipped with zero styles, allowing you to completely customize the look and feel. Bring your preferred styling solution (vanilla CSS, Tailwind, CSS-in-JS libraries, etc...).
