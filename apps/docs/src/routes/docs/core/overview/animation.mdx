# Animation

Kobalte components can be animated with CSS keyframes or your JavaScript animation library of choice. However, there are some caveats noted here in regard to exiting animations with JavaScript animation libraries.

## Animating with CSS animation

The simplest way to animate Kobalte components is with CSS.

You can use CSS animation to animate both mount and unmount phases of several Kobalte components. The latter is possible because this components will suspend unmount while your animation plays out.

```css
.popover__content {
	animation: fadeOut 300ms ease-in forwards;
}

.popover__content[data-expanded] {
	animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
	}
	to {
		opacity: 1;
	}
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
	from {
		opacity: 1;
	}
	to {
		opacity: 0;
	}
}
```

## Delegating unmounting for JavaScript animation

When many stateful Kobalte components are hidden from view, they are actually removed from the DOM. JavaScript animation libraries need control of the unmounting phase, so we provide the `forceMount` prop on many components to allow consumers to delegate the mounting and unmounting of children based on the animation state determined by those libraries.
