# Press interactions

Some Kobalte components normalizes press interactions behavior (mouse, touch, keyboard, and screen readers) across browsers and platforms, and handles many nuances of dealing with pointer and keyboard events.

A press interaction starts when a user presses down with a mouse or their finger on the target, and ends when they move the pointer off the target. It may start again if the pointer re-enters the target. If the pointer is released over the target, then an `onPress` event is fired.

## Features

- Uses pointer events.
- Handles <Kbd>Space</Kbd> or <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> key presses.
- Handles screen reader virtual clicks.
- Normalizes focus behavior on mouse and touch interactions across browsers.
- Handles disabling text selection on mobile while the press interaction is active.
- Handles canceling press interactions on scroll.
- Normalizes many cross browser inconsistencies.

## Example

The following example show how _press events_ are handled in Kobalte's `Button` component.

Press down on the button and drag your pointer off and over to see when the events are fired, and try focusing the button with a keyboard and pressing the <Kbd>Space</Kbd> or <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> keys to trigger events as well.

<Preview>
  <PressInteractionExample />
</Preview>

```tsx
import { Button } from "@kobalte/core";
import { createSignal, For } from "solid-js";

function PressInteractionExample() {
  const [events, setEvents] = createSignal<string[]>([]);

  return (
    <>
      <Button.Root
        onPressStart={e => setEvents(prev => [...prev, `press start with ${e.pointerType}`])}
        onPressEnd={e => setEvents(prev => [...prev, `press end with ${e.pointerType}`])}
        onPress={e => setEvents(prev => [...prev, `press with ${e.pointerType}`])}
      >
        Press me
      </Button.Root>
      <ul>
        <For each={events()}>{e => <li>{e}</li>}</For>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

## API reference

### Press handlers

| Name          | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| onPress       | `(e: PressEvent) => void` <br/> Handler that is called when the press is released over the target.                                                      |
| onPressStart  | `(e: PressEvent) => void` <br/> Handler that is called when a press interaction starts.                                                                 |
| onPressEnd    | `(e: PressEvent) => void` <br/> Handler that is called when a press interaction ends, either over the target or when the pointer leaves the target.     |
| onPressChange | `(isPressed: boolean) => void` <br/> Handler that is called when the press state changes.                                                               |
| onPressUp     | `(e: PressEvent) => void` <br/> Handler that is called when a press is released over the target, regardless of whether it started on the target or not. |

Each of these handlers is fired with a `PressEvent`, which exposes information about the target and the type of event that triggered the interaction.

### PressEvent

| Name        | Description                                                                                                     |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type        | `'press' \| 'pressstart' \| 'pressend' \| 'pressup'` <br/> The type of press event being fired.                 |
| pointerType | `'mouse' \| 'pen' \| 'touch' \| 'keyboard' \| 'virtual'` <br/> The pointer type that triggered the press event. |
| target      | `Element` <br/> The target element of the press event.                                                          |
| shiftKey    | `boolean` <br/> Whether the shift keyboard modifier was held during the press event.                            |
| ctrlKey     | `boolean` <br/> Whether the ctrl keyboard modifier was held during the press event.                             |
| metaKey     | `boolean` <br/> Whether the meta keyboard modifier was held during the press event.                             |
| altKey      | `boolean` <br/> Whether the alt keyboard modifier was held during the press event.                              |
